**genetic algorithm for mario**

I've taken a recent interest in genetic algorithms. To learn about how they are implemented, I decided to write a bot to solve the first level of Super Mario Bros. for the NES using a simple genetic algorithm.

To emulate the NES, I used [FCEUX](fceux), which has built-in Lua scripting support. I didn't want to write the genetic processing code in Lua; Python is a much more capable language. To communicate between the emulator and my program, I used [LuaSocket](luasocket) and Python sockets to communicate over a local TCP server. Each chromosome consists of 12000 genes- over the number of frames possible in the first level of Mario. Each gene is a controller state, represented by a single byte, each bit controlling A, B, up, down, left or right. 2 bits were unused.

When Mario dies, the Lua script reads two values from memory- the screen offset from the beginning of the level (i.e. the distance travelled), and the number of points. These are used to calculate a fitness score, which is sent back to the python server to be associated with that chromosome and used to create the next generation.

Early on, I had a problem: getting over the pipes requires the player to hold the jump button for multiple frames- by my estimates, between 30 and 60. Because the chances of this happening randomly were so low, I helped my program a little- there's a timer that keeps the jump button held for 60 frames after it is pressed.

On my first attempt, each chromosome was initially randomly created, and the chance of a parent reproducing was directly proportional to the fitness. This is what happened to the fitness after about 70 generations:

Although there is a positive trend, it is not very strong, so I tweaked the parameters a bit. First, only the top two performers of each generation would reproduce to create the next generation. This ensured that the population would converge on a solution more quickly, at the cost of variation. Second, instead of randomly creating each gene, I seeded it to be only moving right. This allowed Mario to make progress much more quickly, as he was mostly concerned with jumping over goombas and grabbing coins, rather than basic locomotion. With these changes, this is what the fitness looked like, again after about 70 generations:

This is better; it increases pretty quickly at the beginning, but then quickly hits a plateau- Why? As it turns out, there is a jump about 3/4 through the level:

Mario had to jump exactly as he reached this block, and it took a while to mutate to that point, but it happened eventually. It was very unstable, too- most mutations did not make the jump. However, the ones that did make the jump finished the level.
